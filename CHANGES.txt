Traits CHANGELOG
================

What's new in Traits 4.5.0
--------------------------


Release 4.4.0
-------------

The major new feature in this release is a new adaptation mechanism in the
``traits.adaptation`` package.  The new mechanism is intended to replace the
older traits.protocols package.  Code written against ``traits.protocols`` will
continue to work, although the ``traits.protocols`` API has been deprecated,
and a warning will be logged on first use of ``traits.protocols``.  See the
'Advanced Topics' section of the user manual for more details.

The release also includes improved support for using Cython with `HasTraits`
classes, some new helper utilities for writing unit tests for Traits events,
and a variety of bug fixes, stability enhancements, and internal code
improvements.
